## Get Started

### Android

Get the newest apk release and install, then well done!

It may ask for background location permission, you can deny it safely.  
(Foreground) Location permission is required for scanning Bluetooth devices in newer Android system.

### Windows

Get the newest release archive with "windows" in the file name,  
extract to somewhere and run `start.bat`

### GNU/Linux

You can get the "pure" release, extract it, fire a terminal inside and run:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```

On Arch Linux based distros you may first install `bluez`, as it's often missing  
```bash
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
```

### MacOS

For MacOS please install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

Fetch a "pure" release and do the same in a shell:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```

Currently in Mac the browser will not pop up automatically. Please run manually and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8095`, or just click [here](http://127.0.0.1:8095).


### Worth to Note

For all supported platforms,  
You can also use "pure" edition once you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed,  
or "bare" edition if you also managed to install `bleak` via `pip`.

Command line hackers? Just use `printer.py`!

See the [releases](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer/releases) now!
