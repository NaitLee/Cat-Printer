## Get Started

### Android

Get the newest apk release and install, then well done!

It may ask for background location permission, you can deny it safely.  
(Foreground) Location permission is required for scanning Bluetooth devices in newer Android system.

It is recommended to set scan time to 1 second.

The 3rd-party F-Droid repository [IzzyOnDroid](https://android.izzysoft.de/repo) is known to include Cat-Printer.

### Windows

1. Download [source code](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of this repository and install newest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/).
2. Extract the source code archive, run `install.bat`, wait for it to complete
3. After that, you will get `server.bat` for opening the Web interface. Run it and enjoy

<!-- Build system broken -->
<!-- Get the newest release archive with ‚Äúwindows‚Äù in the file name,  
extract to somewhere and run `start.bat` -->

Windows typically needs longer scan time. Defaults to 4 seconds, try to find your case.

For those who know Python development ‚Äî see `requirements.txt` to find your way, it‚Äôs very simple.

### GNU/Linux

Get source code and run `./install.sh` to set the environment up.

After that, you can always use Cat-Printer inside the given virtual environment:

```
(venv) $ python3 server.py
```

It is recommended to set the scan time to 2 seconds.

On Arch Linux based distros you may install `bluez` first, as it may not be installed by default
```bash
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
```
  
<details>
<summary>Further steps</summary>

You may want to use the command line interface for hackiness:

```
$ python printer.py --help
```

You may or may not need to install ImageMagick and Ghostscript, depending on your distro.

```bash
sudo apt install imagemagick ghostscript
```
or use your distro's package manager.  

Extra configuration is required for ImageMagick to work. Because IM is made for external webserver, a strict security policy is applied. You need to add the following line to `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml` before `</policymap>`:
```xml
 <policy domain="coder" rights="read | write" pattern="PDM" />
```

Because this script is only accesible by localhost, or at most your local network, this is safe.
</details>

*Packaging is also on the way!*

### MacOS

For MacOS please install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/),  
then install `pyobjc` and `bleak` via `pip` in terminal:  
```bash
pip3 install pyobjc bleak
```

After that, get the source code and run:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Worth to Note

For all supported platforms,  
You can also use ‚Äúpure‚Äù edition once you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed,  
or ‚Äúbare‚Äù edition if you also managed to install `bleak` via `pip`.

If you like command-line, installing [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/) could be very helpful.

See the [releases](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer/releases) now!
