  - You can still use the legacy version (0.0.2), with some more editing features

  - Good user interface, with PC/mobile/light/dark mode variants! (system config adaptive)
- Cross platform!
  - Newer Windows 10 and above
  - GNU/Linux
  - MacOS *(Needs testing)*

- Free, as in [freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)!
  - Unlike the "official" proprietary app,  
    this project is for everyone that concerns *open-mind and freedom*!
- and Fun!
  - Do whatever you like!

## Get Started

### Android

Get the newest apk release and install, then well done!

It may ask for background location permission, which is mysterious to me.  
You can deny it safely.

### Windows:

Get the newest release archive with "windows" in the file name,  
extract to somewhere and run `start.bat`

### GNU/Linux

You can get the "pure" release, extract it, fire a terminal inside and run:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```

On Arch Linux based distros you may first install `bluez`, as it's often missing  
```bash
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
```

### MacOS

For MacOS please install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

Fetch a "pure" release and do the same in a shell:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```

Currently in Mac the browser will not pop up automatically. Please run manually and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8095`


### Note

For all supported platforms,  
You can also use "pure" edition once you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed,  
or "bare" edition if you also managed to install `bleak` via `pip`.

See the [releases](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer/releases) now!
